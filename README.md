# Nginx configuration for running Drupal

## Introduction

   This is an example configuration from running Drupal using
   [nginx](http://nginx.org). Which is a high-performance non-blocking
   HTTP server.

   Nginx doesn't use a module like Apache does for PHP support. The
   Apache module approach simplifies a lot of things because what you
   have in reality is nothing less than a PHP engine running on top of
   the HTTP server. 

   Instead nginx uses [FastCGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCGI)
   to proxy all requests for PHP processing to a php fastcgi daemon that
   is waiting for incoming requests and then handles the php file
   being requested.

   Although the fcgi approach is more cumbersome to set up it provides
   a greater degree of control over which actions are permitted, hence
   greater security.

   This configuration started life as a fork of
   [perusio's](https://github.com/perusio/drupal-with-nginx) which was a fork of
   [yhager's](github.com/yhager/nginx_drupal) configuration, tempered
   by [omega8cc](http://github.com/omega8cc/nginx-for-drupal) and
   [Brian Mercer](http://test.brianmercer.com/content/nginx-configuration-drupal)
   configurations. 
   
   I've since then changed it substantially. Tried to remove as best
   as I can the traces of bad habits promoted by Apache's
   configuration logic. Namely the use of a `.htaccess` and what it
   entails in terms or _reverse logic_ on the server
   configuration. I've incorporated tidbits and advices gotten,
   mostly, from the nginx mailing list and the
   [nginx Wiki](http://wiki.nginx.org).

## Layout
   
   The configuration comes in **two** flavors:
   
   1. Regular Drupal configuration for a site not relying on
     [custom_url_rewrite_outbound](http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/developer--hooks--core.php/function/custom_url_rewrite_outbound/6). That's
      the majority of sites out there. This corresponds to the file
      `drupal.conf`.


   2. Drupal configuration for a site that makes use of
     [custom_url_rewrite_outbound](http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/developer--hooks--core.php/function/custom_url_rewrite_outbound/6)
      something that the [purl](http://drupal.org/project/purl) module
      does and is then used in
      [spaces](http://drupal.org/project/spaces). Two very popular
      drupal based projects make use of it:
      [OpenAtrium](http://openatrium.com) and [ManagingNews](http://managingnews.com).
    
     That corresponds to the configuration file `drupal_spaces.conf`.
      
     Each of these configurations can make use of
     [Boost](http://drupal.org/project/boost). With the files being
      `drupal_boost.conf`, for the regular drupal site, or
      `drupal_spaces_boost.conf` for sites that use custom URL
      rewrites, like [OpenAtrium](http://openatrium.com) and [ManagingNews](http://managingnews.com).
      
Furthermore there are **two** options for each configuration:

   1. A **non drush aware** option that uses `wget/curl` to run cron
      and updating the site using `update.php`, i.e., via a web
      interface. 

   2. A **drush aware flavor** that runs cron and updates the site
      using [drush](http://drupal.org/project/drush).

      To get drush to run cron jobs the easiest way is to define your
      own [site aliases](http://drupal.org/node/670460). See the
      example aliases file `example.aliases.drushrc.php` that comes
      under the `examples` directory in the drush distribution.

      Example: You create the aliases for example.com and example.org,
      with aliases `@excom` and `@exnet` respectively.

      Your crontab should contain something like:

          COLUMNS=80
          DRUSH=/full/path/to/drush
          */50 * * * * $DRUSH @excom cron -q
          1 2 * * * $DRUSH @exnet cron -q

      This means that the cron job for example.com will be run every
      50 minutes and the cron job for example.net will be run every
      day at 02:01 hours. Check the section 7 of the Drupal
      `INSTALL.txt` for further details about running cron.

      Note that the `/path/to/drush` is the path to the **shell script
      wrapper** that comes with drush not to to the `drush.php`
      script. If using `drush.php` then add `php` in front of the
      `/path/to/drush.php`.
    
## Configuration Selection Algorithm

   1. I'm **not using** spaces or any module that relies in custom URL
      rewrites. Use the `drupal.conf` config in your vhost (`server`
      block): `include includes/drupal.conf;`.
   
   2. I'm running [OpenAtrium](http://openatrium.com),
      [ManagingNews](http://managingnews.com) or any other site that
      **uses** [spaces](http://drupal.org/project/spaces). Use the
      `drupal_spaces.conf` config in your vhost (`server` block):
      `include includes/drupal_spaces.conf;`
    
   3. I'm using [Boost](http://drupal.org/project/boost) for caching
      on my drupal site and **not using** spaces or any module that
      relies in custom URL rewrites. Use the `drupal_boost.conf`
      config in your vhost (`server` block): `include
      includes/drupal_boost.conf;`
      
   4. I'm using [Boost](http://drupal.org/project/boost) and running
      [OpenAtrium](http://openatrium.com),
      [ManagingNews](http://managingnews.com) or any other site that
      **uses** [spaces](http://drupal.org/project/spaces). Use the
      `drupal_spaces_boost.conf` config in your vhost (`server`
      block): `include includes/drupal_spaces_boost.conf;`
   
   5. I'm **not using drush** for updating and running
      cron. Additionally you should also include the
      `drupal_cron_update.conf` config in your vhost (`server`
      block): `include includes/drupal_cron_update.conf;`


## Drupal 6 Global Redirect and the 0 Rewrites Configuration

There's a setting that is enabled by default in
[`globalredirect`](http://drupal.org/project/globalredirect) that
removes the trailing slash in the URIs. That setting creates a
redirect loop with the **0 rewrites config** provided by
`includes/drupal.conf` or `includes/drupal_boost.conf`
if using [Boost](http://drupal.org/project/boost).

There are two ways to deal with that:

 1. Install the module
    [`nginx_fast_config`](http://drupal.org/project/nginx_fast_config)
    that takes care of this setting removing it from the settings form
    at `/admin/settings/globalredirect` and presents a status line on
    the status page at `/admin/reports/status`. This module fixes the
    issues for you.
    
 2. Take care of the **deslash** setting yourself by disabling it at
    `/admin/settings/globalredirect`. Note that this is enabled by
    **default**. 
    
This is strictly a **drupal 6** issue.

## General Features

   1. The use of two `server` directives to do the domain name
   rewriting, usually redirecting `www.example.com` to `example.com`
   or vice-versa. As recommended in
   [nginx Wiki Pitfalls](http://wiki.nginx.org/Pitfalls#Server_Name)
   page.

   2. **Clean URL** support.

   3. Access control for `cron.php`. It can only be requested from a
   set of IPs addresses you specify. This is for the **non drush
   aware** version.

   4. Support for the [Boost](http://drupal.org/project/boost) module.

   5. Support for virtual hosts. The `example.com.conf` file.

   6. Support for [Sitemaps](http://drupal.org/project/site_map) RSS feeds.

   7. Support for the
      [Filefield Nginx Progress](http://drupal.org/project/filefield_nginx_progress)
      module for the upload progress bar.

   8. Use of **non-capturing** regex for all directives that are not
      rewrites that need to use URI components.1

   9. IPv6 and IPv4 support.
   
   10. Support for **private file** serving in drupal.

   11. Use of UNIX sockets in `/tmp/` subdirectory with permissions
       **700**, i.e., accessible only to the user running the process.
       You may consider the
       [init script](github.com/perusio/php-fastcgi-debian-script)
       that I make available here on github that launches the PHP
       FastCGI daemon and spawns new instances as required.
  
   12. End of the [expensive 404s](http://drupal.org/node/76824
       "Expensive 404s issue") that Drupal usually handles when
       using Apache with the default `.htaccess`.
  
   13. Possibility of using **Apache** as a backend for dealing with
       PHP. Meaning using Nginx as
       [reverse proxy](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpProxyModule "Nginx
       Proxy Module").
   
   
## Secure HTTP aka SSL/TLS support

   1. By default and since version
      [0.8.21](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html
      "Nginx SSL/TLS protocol supported defaults") only SSLv3 and
      TLSv1 are supported. The anonymous Diffie-Hellman (ADH) key
      exchange and MD5 message autentication algorithms are not
      supported. They can be enabled explicitly but due to their
      **insecure** nature they're discouraged. The same goes for
      SSLv2.
      
   2. SSL/TLS shared cache for SSL session resume support of 10
      MB. SSL session timeout is set to 10 minutes.
      
   3. Note that for session resumption to work the setting of the SSL
      socket as default, at least, is required. Meaning a listen
      directive like this:
      
      `listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;`
      
      This is so because session resumption takes place before any TLS
      extension is enabled, namely
      [Server Name Indication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication
      "SNI"). The ClientHello message requests a session ID from a
      given IP address (server). Therefore the default server setting
      is **required**.
       
      Another option, the one I've chosen here, is to move the
      `ssl_session_cache` directive to the `http` context setting. Of
      course the downside of this approach is that the
      `ssl_session_cache` settings are the same for **all** configured
      virtual hosts.
      
## Security Features

   1. The use of a `default` configuration file to block all illegal
      `Host` HTTP header requests.

   2. Access control using
      [HTTP Basic Auth](http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpAuthBasicModule)
      for `install.php` and other Drupal sensitive files. The
      configuration expects a password file named `.htpasswd-users` in
      the top nginx configuration directory, usually `/etc/nginx`. I
      provide an empty file. This is also for the **non drush aware**
      version.

      If you're on Debian or any of its derivatives like Ubuntu you
      need the
      [apache2-utils](http://packages.debian.org/search?suite%3Dall&section%3Dall&arch%3Dany&searchon%3Dnames&keywords%3Dapache2-utils)
      package installed. Then create your password file by issuing:

          htpasswd -d -b -c .htpasswd-users <user> <password>

      You should delete this command from your shell history
      afterwards with `history -d <command number>` or alternatively
      omit the `-b` switch, then you'll be prompted for the password.

      This creates the file (there's a `-c` switch). For adding
      additional users omit the `-c`.

      Of course you can rename the password file to whatever you want,
      then accordingly change its name in drupal_boost.conf.

   3. Support for
      [X-Frame-Options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/The_X-FRAME-OPTIONS_response_header)
      HTTP header to avoid Clickjacking attacks.

   4. Protection of the upload directory. You can try to bypass the
      UNIX `file` utility or the PHP `Fileinfo` extension and upload a
      fake jpeg:
   
          echo -e "\xff\xd8\xff\xe0\n<?php echo 'hello'; ?>" > test.jpg
      
      If you run `php test.jpg`  you get 'hello'. The fact is that **all
      files** with php extension are either matched by a particular
      location, as is the case for `index.php`, `xmlrpc.php`,
      `update.php` and `install.php` or match the last directive of
      the configuration:

          location ~* ^.+\.php$ {
            return 404; 
          }

      Returning a 404 (Not Found) for every PHP file not matched by
      all the previous locations.

   5. Use of [Strict Transport Security](http://www.chromium.org/sts
      "STS at chromium.org") for enhanced security. It forces during
      the specified period for the configured domain to be contacted
      only over HTTPS. Requires a modern browser to be of use, i.e.,
      **Chrome/Chromium**, **Firefox 4** or **Firefox with
      NoScript**.
      
   6. DoS prevention with a _low_ number of connections by client
      allowed: **16**. This number can be adjusted as you see fit.
   
   7. The Drupal specific headers like `X-Drupal-Cache` provided by
      [pressflow](https://github.com/pressflow/6) or the `X-Generator`
      header that Drupal 7 sets are both **hidden**. 

## Private file handling

   This config assumes that **private** files are stored under a directory
   named `private`. I suggest `sites/default/files/private` or
   `sites/<sitename>/files/private` but can be anywhere inside the site
   root as long as you keep the top level directory name `private`. If
   you want to have a different name for the top level then replace in
   the location `~* private` in `drupal.conf` and/or `drupal7.conf`
   the name of your private files top directory.

   Example: Calling the top level private files directory `protected`
   instead of `private`.
       
       location ^~ /sites/default/files/protected {
         internal;
       }
  
   Now any attempt to access the files under this directory directly
   will return a 404.

   Note that this practice it's not what's usually
   [recommended](http://drupal.org/node/344806 "Drupal handbook page
   on private files"). The _usual_ practice involves setting up a
   directory outside of files directory and giving write permissions to
   the web server user. While that might be a simple alternative in
   the sense that doesn't require to tweak the web server
   configuration, I think it to be less advisable, in the sense that
   now there's **another** directory that is writable by the server. 
   
   I prefer to use a directory under `files`, which is the only one
   that is writable by the web server, and use the above location
   (`protected` or `private`) to block access by the client to it.
   
   Also bear in mind that the above configuration stanza is for a
   drupal 7 or a drupal 6 site not relying on
   [purl](http://drupal.org/project/purl). For sites that use it,
   e.g., sites/products based on
   [spaces](http://drupal.org/project/spaces) like
   [OpenAtrium](http://openatrium.com) or
   [ManagingNews](http://managingnews.com) require a **regex** based
   location, i.e.:
   
       location ~* /sites/default/files/protected {
         internal;
       }
   
   in order to work properly.
   
## Fast Private File Transfer

   Nginx implements
   [Lighty X-Sendfile](http://blog.lighttpd.net/articles/2006/07/02/x-sendfile
   "Lighty's life blog post on X-Sendfile") using the header:
   [X-Accel-Redirect](http://wiki.nginx.org/XSendfile "Nginx
   implementation of X-Sendfile").
   
   This allows **fast** private file transfers. I've developed a
   module tailored for Nginx:
   [nginx\_accel\_redirect](http://drupal.org/project/nginx_accel_redirect "Module for Drupal providing fast private file transfer"). 


## Connections per client and DoS Mitigation

   The **connection zone** defined, called `arbeit` allows for **16**
   connections to be established for each client. That seems to me to
   be a _reasonable_ number. It could happen that you have a setup
   with lots of CDNs (see this
   [issue](https://github.com/perusio/drupal-with-nginx/issues#issue/2))
   or extensive
   [domain sharding](http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/05/12/sharding-dominant-domains/)
   and the number of allowed connections by client can be greater than
   16, specially when using Nginx as a reverse proxy. 
   
   It may happen that 16 is not enough and you start getting a lot of
   `503 Service Unavailable` status codes as a reply from the
   server. In that case tweak the value of `limit_conn` until you have
   a working setup. This number must be as small as possible as a way
   to mitigate the potential for DoS attacks.

## Nginx as a Reverse Proxy: Proxying to Apache for PHP

   If you **absolutely need** to use the rather _bad habit_ of
   deploying web apps relying on `.htaccess`, or you just want to use
   Nginx as a reverse proxy. The config allows you to do so. Note that
   this provides some benefits over using only Apache, since Nginx is
   much faster than Apache. Furthermore you can use the proxy cache
   and/or use Nginx as a load balancer. 

## Static index.html file

   The `/` location is a **_fallback_** location, meaning that after
   trying all other, more specific locations, Nginx, will return here.
   
   Since there's a `try_files $uri` directive with `@cache`, if using
   [Boost](http://drupal.org/project/boost), or `@drupal`, or
   `index.php?q=$uri&$args` otherwise, as fallback it will return a
   404 if no file is found. Even if you have an `index.html` file at
   the root. That is for a request URI of `/`. It will work however
   with `/index.html`, since that's the argument of the `try_files`
   directive.
   
   There's several possible ways to fix that. Be with nested locations
   inside `location /` or with an aditional `try_files $uri/index.html`.
   
   The one I opted for is instead making use of the
   [`error_page`](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpCoreModule#error_page)
   directive. There's an exact location `/` that issues a
   200 code and serves `/index.html` when a 404 is returned.
   
## Installation

   1. Move the old `/etc/nginx` directory to `/etc/nginx.old`.
   
   2. Clone the git repository from github:
   
      `git clone https://github.com/perusio/drupal-with-nginx.git`
   
   3. Edit the `sites-available/example.com.conf` configuration file to
      suit your requirements. Namely replacing example.com with
      **your** domain.
   
   4. Setup the PHP handling method. It can be:
   
      + Upstream HTTP server like Apache with mod_php. To use this
        method comment out the `include upstream_phpcgi.conf;`
        line in `nginx.conf` and uncomment the lines:
        
            include reverse_proxy.conf;
            include upstream_phpapache.conf;

        Now you must set the proper address and port for your
        backend(s) in the `upstream_phpapache.conf`. By default it
        assumes the loopback `127.0.0.1` interface on port
        `8080`. Adjust accordingly to reflect your setup.

        Comment out **all**  `fastcgi_pass` directives in either
        `drupal_boost.conf` or `drupal_boost_drush.conf`, depending
        which config layout you're using. Uncomment out all the
        `proxy_pass` directives. They have a comment around them,
        stating these instructions.
      
      + FastCGI process using php-cgi. In this case an
        [init script](https://github.com/perusio/php-fastcgi-debian-script
        "Init script for php-cgi") is
        required. This is how the server is configured out of the
        box. It uses UNIX sockets. You can use TCP sockets if you prefer.
      
      + [PHP FPM](http://www.php-fpm.org "PHP FPM"), this requires you
        to configure your fpm setup, in Debian/Ubuntu this is done in
        the `/etc/php5/fpm` directory.
       
         Look
         [here](https://github.com/perusio/php-fpm-example-config) for
         an **example configuration** of `php-fpm`.

       
      Check that the socket is properly created and is listening. This
      can be done with `netstat`, like this for UNIX sockets:
      
         netstat --unix -l
         
      And like this for TCP sockets:   
         
         netstat -t -l
   
      It should display the PHP CGI socket.
   
      Note that the default socket type is UNIX and the config assumes
      it to be listening on `unix:/tmp/php-cgi/php-cgi.socket`, if
      using the `php-cgi`, or in `unix:/var/run/php-fpm.sock` using
      `php-fpm` and that you should **change** to reflect your setup
      by editing `upstream_phpcgi.conf`.
   
   
   5. Create the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` directory and enable the
      virtual host using one of the methods described below. 
      
      Note that if you're using the
      [nginx_ensite](http://github.com/perusio/nginx_ensite) script
      described below it **creates** the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`
      directory if it doesn't exist the first time you run it for
      enabling a site.
    
   6. Reload Nginx:
   
      `/etc/init.d/nginx reload`
   
   7. Check that your site is working using your browser.
   
   8. Remove the `/etc/nginx.old` directory.
   
   9. Done.
   
## Enabling and Disabling Virtual Hosts

   I've created a shell script
   [nginx_ensite](http://github.com/perusio/nginx_ensite) that lives
   here on github for quick enabling and disabling of virtual hosts.
   
   If you're not using that script then you have to **manually**
   create the symlinks from `sites-enabled` to `sites-available`. Only
   the virtual hosts configured in `sites-enabled` will be available
   for Nginx to serve.


## Acessing the php-fpm status and ping pages

   You can get the
   [status and a ping](http://forum.nginx.org/read.php?3,56426) pages
   for the running instance of `php-fpm`. There's a
   `php_fpm_status.conf` file with the configuration for both
   features.
   
   + the **status page** at `/fpm-status`;
     
   + the **ping page** at `/ping`.

   For obvious reasons these pages are acessed only from a given set
   of IP addresses. In the suggested configuration only from
   localhost and non-routable IPs of the 192.168.1.0 network.
    
   The allowed hosts are defined in a geo block in file
   `php_fpm_status_allowed_hosts.conf`. You should edit the predefined
   IP addresses to suit your setup. 
 
   To enable the status and ping pages uncomment the line in the
   `example.com.conf` virtual host configuration file.

## Getting the latest Nginx packaged for Debian or Ubuntu

   I maintain a [debian repository](http://debian.perusio.net/unstable
   "my debian repo") with the
   [latest](http://nginx.org/en/download.html "Nginx source download")
   version of Nginx. This is packaged for Debian **unstable** or
   **testing**. The instructions for using the repository are
   presented on this [page](http://debian.perusio.net/debian.html
   "Repository instructions").
 
   It may work or not on Ubuntu. Since Ubuntu seems to appreciate more
   finding semi-witty names for their releases instead of making clear
   what's the status of the software included, meaning. Is it
   **stable**? Is it **testing**? Is it **unstable**? The package may
   work with your currently installed environment or not. I don't have
   the faintest idea which release to advise. So you're on your
   own. Generally the APT machinery will sort out for you any
   dependencies issues that might exist.

## Ad and Aditional modules support

   The config is quite tight in the sense that if you have something
   that is not contemplated in the **exact** match locations,
   `/index.php`, `/install.php`, etc, and you try to make it work it
   will fail. Some Drupal modules like
   [ad](http://drupal.org/project/ad "Ad module") provide a PHP
   script. This script needs to be invoked. In the case of the **ad
   module** you must add the following location block:
   
       location = /sites/all/modules/ad/serve.php {
          fastcgi_pass phpcgi;
        }
   
   Of course this assumes that you installed the ad module such that
   is usable for all sites. To make it usable when targeting a single
   site, e.g., `mysite.com`, insert instead:
       
       location = /sites/mysite.com/modules/ad/serve.php {
          fastcgi_pass phpcgi;
       }   
       
    Proceed similarly for other modules requiring the usage of PHP
    scripts like `ad`.   

## On groups.drupal.org

   There's a [nginx](http://groups.drupal.org/nginx)
   groups.drupal.org group for sharing and learning more about using
   nginx with Drupal.

## Monitoring nginx

   I use [Monit](http://mmonit.com) for supervising the nginx
   daemon. Here's my
   [configuration](http://github.com/perusio/monit-miscellaneous) for
   nginx.

## Caveat emptor

   You should **always** test the configuration with `nginx -t` to see
   if everything is correct. Only after a successful should you reload
   nginx. On Debian and any of its derivatives you can also test the
   configuration by invoking the init script as: `/etc/init.d/nginx
   testconfig`.

## My other nginx configs on github

   + [WordPress](https://github.com/perusio/wordpress-nginx "WordPress Nginx
     config")

   + [Chive](https://github.com/perusio/chive-nginx "Chive Nginx
     config")
     
   + [Piwik](https://github.com/perusio/piwik-nginx "Piwik Nginx config")

## Securing your PHP configuration

   I have created a small shell script that parses your `php.ini` and
   sets a sane environment, be it for **development** or
   **production** settings. 
   
   Grab it [here](https://github.com/perusio/php-ini-cleanup "PHP
   cleanup script").

## TODO

   + Implement the handling of Nginx
     [memcached](http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpMemcachedModule) backend.
     
   + Implement caching with the use of the
     [Nginx Cache purge](https://github.com/FRiCKLE/ngx_cache_purge) module.

## Acknowledgments

   The great bunch at the [Nginx](http://groups.drupal.org/nginx
   "Nginx Drupal group") group on groups.drupal.org. They've helped me
   sort out the snafus on this config and offered insights on how to
   improve it.
